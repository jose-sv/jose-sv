### I am Jose Rodrigo Sanchez Vicarte

I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, working under Chris Fletcher. My work lives in the intersection of Adversarial Machine Learning and Hardware Security.

I received my B.S. from Lawrence Technological University (in Southfield, MI), where I was a two time recipient of a Presidential Research Grant.

I went on to complete my M.S. at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in the fall of 2019. My M.S. culminated in the introduction of [Asynchronous Poisoning Attacks](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3373376.3378462).

Feel free to contact me josers2 [at] illinois [dot] edu with any questions about my papers or research, job openings, or anything else.
